When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when you want to colaborate with someone and working together on some project that is in beeta phase

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because you may want to pull changes when you're finished editing it

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branches involves only one repository sometimes you want to make a commit history that branches out in multiple version and you don't want to make chane in your master branch
    clone involves any two repositories either they're located locally or remotely and create exact copy of it
    fork is also a clone but it's the clone github does it on their machines that means both the repositries original and forked one are on github

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    it came in to play when you're collaborating with someone and both repository and local repository have something(commits)that other don't have 
    so you can merge the changes without loosing any commit

and what would be harder?
